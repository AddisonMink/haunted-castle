# Haunted Castle
A 10-room Zelda-like game I made in Pico8! Puzzles! Monsters! Treasure! Hooray!

You can play it [here](https://addisonmink.github.io/haunted-castle/haunted-castle.html)! It runs in the Pico-8 fantasy console. By default it's arrow keys to move and X and Z for face buttons.

Get chased around by awful little mooks!
